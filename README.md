# nw
Needleman and Wunsch sequence alignment of files in PIR format.

See `INSTALL.md` for installation instructions.

Note that you need to have BiopLib (github.com/ACRMGroup/bioplib)
installed to compile nw if downloaded from GitHub. If you have
obtained the packaged version, you do not need BiopLib as relevant
files are included.
